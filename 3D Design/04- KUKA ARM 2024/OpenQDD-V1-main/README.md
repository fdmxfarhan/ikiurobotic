# OpenQDD V1
OpenQDD is a 3D-printed open-source robotic actuator that I designed to be a powerful, easy-to-build, and relatively inexpensive solution for creating dynamic robots. Robots like Spot, Atlas, and the MIT mini cheetah easily impress the eye with their agility, speed, and overall ability to mimic natural motion. With OpenQDD, creating high-performing actuators at an affordable price is possible.
